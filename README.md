# Full Stack Open Blog Project (Modified)

This is a modified version of the Full Stack Open Blog project, with a sign-up page that works and an improved UI using Tailwind CSS. The goal is to further refactor the project into a Reddit/Twitter clone.

## Reddit Clone Features

The Reddit clone will allow users to upvote or downvote blog posts. The most upvoted posts will be shown at the top of the page when first loaded. Users will be able to filter by rising, hot, new, and other filters that Reddit offers.

The view button will also be changed to work more like Reddit, allowing users to comment on posts and upvote/downvote those comments as well.

## Twitter/Instagram Clone Features

In addition to the Reddit clone, we plan to implement features from Twitter and Instagram to improve the site's aesthetics. Users will be able to search for other users, view their posts, and perform other actions typical of social media platforms.

## Live Demo

A live demo of this project is available at https://wandering-sound-6626.fly.dev/.

Feel free to explore the features and functionality, and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. We are always looking for ways to improve the project and welcome contributions from the community.
